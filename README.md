## Contributing

See `contributing.md` for ways to get started.

Please adhere to this project's `code of conduct`.


## Optimizations

This code was created to be easy to use and easy to ensure that you have the most up to date version of the archive. It keeps a database record of urls that have already been downloaded so thaty ou can avoid downloading the same posts over and over. There will be more coming in the future that will allow it to hash individual images and videos to determine if they have already been saved or not to compeletely eliminate duplicates.


## FAQ

#### Can I scrape onlyfans or fansly with this?

No, this scraper only works with coomer.su

#### Does this scraper cost anything?

No, there is no fee to use this software. Donations are welcome (see the donations section) but are not required.
